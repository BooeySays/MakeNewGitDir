# MakeNewGitDir

I'veI been making a lot of new git repos lately. 

.. and obviously, with that comes a lot of file
creating, editing, staging, COMMITING, and push-
ing.

I am a PRO-CLJ supporter.. a Keyboard / Mouse
kind of guy. But some commands are just plain
annoying to enter over and over again.

So... I finally had enough and made this script.

The script creates a few functions that uses two
CLI programs: git & hub

So those two apps will need to be installed.
(Note: 	You do not have to install them before
		hand. the script will check for the
		(apps during the install and wil
offer to installbany of the apps if they are
not installed.
  editing files, adding theust new files to the 
repos, commiting, and then pushing them
